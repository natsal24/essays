    <p>The image depicts a leaf beetle (Aulacophora indica) (Family: Chrysomelidae; subfamily: Galerucinae) looking out from a leaf hole of Alnus nepalensis tree. Adult leaf beetles make holes in host plant leaves while feeding. They camouflage themselves with these holes.</p>

    <h2>
      Chitwan National Park, Nepal
    </h2>
    
<ve-map center="Q1075023" right>
    </ve-map>
    <p>The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above. The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is
      <code>
        Q1075023
      </code>
      . When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.</p>
<p>An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates. In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates
      <code>
        27.5,84.333
      </code>
      , resulting in an identical map.</p>
<p>Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer. Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.</p>
