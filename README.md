# Torres-Ortiz Family History
The Torres-Ortiz Family were originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Throughout the mid-20th century the family moved across the United States. We follow their journey not only to learn how they were able to integrate into American culture, but also what aspects of their own culture they chose to preserve.

    <p>The image depicts a leaf beetle (Aulacophora indica) (Family: Chrysomelidae; subfamily: Galerucinae) looking out from a leaf hole of Alnus nepalensis tree. Adult leaf beetles make holes in host plant leaves while feeding. They camouflage themselves with these holes.</p>

    <p>The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above. The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is
      <code>
        Q1075023
      </code>
      . When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.</p>
<p>An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates. In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates
      <code>
        27.5,84.333
      </code>
      , resulting in an identical map.</p>
<p>Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer. Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.</p>
